### Hi! 

I'm Sonja (pronounced SO-nyah), a junior at Ohio State University studying Computer Information Science through the College of Arts and Sciences. I'm minoring in Honors Math and Religious Studies. I've worked in front-end development and software development, and am trying to get into the game design industry. I've always had a passion for games and have always wanted to design and build them, but have only recently had the time to get integrated with it. Never too late though!

I'm currently looking for an internship for Summer 2021. Check out my [resume](Sonja_Linton_Resume.pdf) or my [portfolio](https://allysonja.github.io), and feel free to peruse my github repos. I have a few fun projects here!

#### Overview
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on school projects such as CSE 3902, Game Design Project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning middleman and ruby on my own time, as you can see with my portfolio site!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! I'm always looking to learn something new or work on a project, and would love to grab a coffee or have a chat with you.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at sonjamw17@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/hers/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I recently ran my first marathon and hope to run another soon! I enjoy listening to music, running, and playing video games.
